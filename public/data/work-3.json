  "description": "The challenges stemming from traditional student record-keeping methods arise from manual processes, disorganized data management, limited accessibility, and the potential for human errors. Relying on physical files or disjointed digital systems hampers efficiency, while disconnected departments lead to duplication and confusion. Restricted access based on physical proximity restricts timely communication, and manual data entry introduces inaccuracies. These issues collectively hinder effective record management and communication within educational institutions.",
